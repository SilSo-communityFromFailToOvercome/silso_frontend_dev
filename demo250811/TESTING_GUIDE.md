# 🧪 Kakao Login Testing Guide

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### **Korean Auth Service:**
- ✅ Removed problematic Kakao SDK dependencies 
- ✅ Fixed import errors and red lines
- ✅ Added demo login method for testing
- ✅ Simplified secure storage (removed for now)
- ✅ Focus on backend communication

### **Current Implementation:**
- ✅ **Backend server** running and healthy
- ✅ **Demo Kakao login** button working
- ✅ **Firebase integration** ready
- ✅ **Error handling** implemented

## 🚀 **How to Test Now**

### **1. Make sure backend is running:**
```bash
cd /Users/yeski/Documents/Silso_MVP_1.0/silso-auth-backend
npm run dev
```

Should show:
```
🚀 Silso Auth Backend Server Started
📡 Server running on port: 3001
🔥 Firebase Project: mvp2025-d40f9
🟡 Kakao Integration: Ready
```

### **2. Start Flutter app:**
```bash
cd /Users/yeski/Documents/Silso_MVP_1.0/silso_backend_dev/mvp
flutter run
```

### **3. Test the Kakao Login:**
1. **Look for yellow "카카오 로그인" button**
2. **Tap the button**
3. **Expected flow:**
   - Button shows "로그인 중..." (logging in...)
   - App checks backend health
   - Sends demo token to backend
   - Backend creates Firebase token
   - User gets logged into app
   - Navigates to home screen

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Backend server not available"**
```bash
# Check if backend is running:
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Should return:
{"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","service":"Silso Auth Backend"}
```

### **"Kakao demo sign in failed"**
- Check Flutter console for detailed error messages
- Ensure backend server is running on port 3001
- Check Firebase service account is properly configured

### **Import errors in IDE**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild:
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

## 📱 **What Works Now**

### **✅ Working Features:**
- Backend server with Kakao token verification
- Firebase custom token creation
- Demo Kakao login button
- Health check functionality
- Error handling and user feedback
- Korean UI text

### **🔄 Next Steps After Demo Works:**
1. **Add real Kakao OAuth flow** (web popup/redirect)
2. **Add mobile Kakao SDK** integration
3. **Add token storage** with flutter_secure_storage
4. **Production deployment** of backend
5. **Business verification** for email access

## 🎯 **Demo Login Flow**

```
User taps "카카오 로그인" button
       ↓
Flutter app checks backend health
       ↓
Sends demo token: "demo_kakao_access_token_for_testing"
       ↓
Backend receives demo token
       ↓
Backend creates Firebase custom token
       ↓
Flutter app signs in to Firebase
       ↓
User authenticated and redirected to home screen
```

Look for these messages:
```
🟡 Starting Kakao DEMO login...

### **Backend Console:**
